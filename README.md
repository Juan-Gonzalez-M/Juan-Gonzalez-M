## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ ##

My name is Juan Manuel Gonzalez Masulli, and Iâ€™m an economist with a MSc in Financial Economics.

Right now, Iâ€™m teaching at the Universidad Catolica Nuestra SeÃ±ora de la AsunciÃ³n subject like Introduction to Econometrics and Financial and Banking Economics.

Iâ€™m interest in everything related to macroeconomics and financial economics, and anything in-between. I hope to colaborate in the area, researching and heping with everything I can.
